# Next Actions

Last updated: 2026-07-18

## Phase 10A-R — completed

All architecture, safety, normalization, merge, reporting, and validation work
is implemented. Acceptance result: 614 tests passed with no production data or
network requests.

## Phase 10A-S — completed

The bounded smoke test passed with 2 requests, 0 retries, 80,059 compressed raw
bytes, 1,000 in-range rows, 0 rejects, a valid nonterminal partition commit,
correct resume state, and a fail-closed incomplete merge.

## Phase 10B — completed

All historical and live segments are terminal. The validated merge contains
9,861,209 outcome-free market rows and 427,090 event tickers. Outcomes remain
separate and quarantined.

## Phase 10C — completed

Implementation, production preflight, corrected 200-event smoke, all 86
production partitions, and the deterministic final merge are complete.
Production retrieved all 427,090 events and published 208,598 milestone
associations with zero missing events or merge conflicts. Final no-network
resume, recursive quarantine inspection, hashes, disk accounting, and the
636-test acceptance suite pass.

## Phase 10D — completed

The complete outcome-free production universes produced 625,923 candidate rows
for 427,090 composite families. All candidate, family-review, and decision
rows remain `needs_review`; verified fields are blank, zero anchors were
verified, and zero outcomes were read. All four required outputs passed
deterministic rerun, quarantine, schema, hash, and storage validation.

## Phase 10E — exact next phase

1. Review the Phase 10D family and candidate evidence without outcome access.
2. Populate the exact verification-decision handoff only through a human or
   separately approved review. Do not infer verification from API presence.
3. Apply and validate the reviewed decisions, leaving `needs_review`, rejected,
   ambiguous, and unmatched families ineligible.
4. Stop before horizon and price construction until the verified-anchor handoff
   is complete and accepted.

## Approval gates

Ask the project owner before changing the frozen methodology, deleting any
validated data, exceeding 5 GiB of generated data, allowing free space below
80 GiB, using credentials/private access, or choosing between research designs
with materially different interpretations.
